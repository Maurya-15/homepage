                Session cookies are stored on your device and remain on it for the duration of your visit to our websites. When you close your browser, any session cookies that have been set will be automatically removed from your computer’s memory. An example would be to remember the progress of an application or inputs in a tool or calculator.<br><br>

                Persistent cookies are stored on your device and remain there until they reach the expiration date or you choose to delete them. At this point, the browser will delete the cookie from your computer’s hard drive. Whilst the persistent cookie is present, the website that created it will have access to that cookie each time you return to that particular website. Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences and tailor our services to your requirements.<br><br>

                We make use of both types of cookie in order to maximise the security of our services and to ensure you always get an optimal experience from our websites. We do not use cookies to track your use of the internet after leaving our websites, nor do we store any information about you in cookies that others (these third parties are outlined below) could read and understand.<br><br>

                First and third party cookies - whether a cookie is 'first' or 'third-party’ refers to the website/service placing the cookie. First-party cookies are those set by us. Third-party cookies are cookies that are authorised by us but provided by one of our suppliers. In some limited cases, we may use our suppliers to manage some of these cookies for us, but we never allow any third party to use these cookies for their own purposes.

                Our website offers information about investing and saving, but not personal advice. If you're not sure which investments are right for you, please request advice, for example from our financial advisers. If you decide to invest, read our important investment notes first and remember that investments can go up and down in value, so you could get back less than you put in.</p>
