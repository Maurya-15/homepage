            <p class="mainContent">
            We believe everyone should be able to access all our products and services, no matter how they choose to contact us. We work hard to build our websites so that they are accessible and easy to use, by designing them with reference to guidelines laid down by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).

            So that you can have an improved online experience, we undertook a specific site build incorporating key accessibility factors (see below). We want the site to be easy to navigate and have designed both content and layout so that it is easy to read.

            <h1 class="subHeading">Changing the size of the text</h1>
            <p class="mainContent">
                This website has been optimised for a screen resolution of 1024 x 768. If you are using a higher screen resolution most modern browsers will allow you to zoom in or out, thus increasing the font size, size of images etc. Whilst this may differ from browser to browser, most commonly zooming is achieved by holding the 'CTRL' key and pressing '+' or '-' on your keyboard. If you have a mouse wheel, you can also hold the 'CTRL' key and roll the wheel forwards or backwards to zoom.
            </p>
            <h1 class="subHeading">News article font size</h1>
            <p class="mainContent">
                We understand that reading long articles can at times be difficult, especially when the font size is small. In recognising this problem, we have added a further option on news articles which will allow you to change the size of the article text. It will not affect the font size of the rest of the site and will be reset when you leave that page.
            </p>
            <h1 class="subHeading">Other ways to increase usability</h1>
            <p class="mainContent">
                We use colours both to help structure and segment the page content, and also to make the site look more attractive. However, we recognise that for some users the use of colours and graphics can affect their enjoyment of the site. You can change the colour, background colour or switch off graphics completely by selecting from the options available in your browser.
            </p>
            <h1 class="subHeading">Screen Readers</h1>
            <p class="mainContent">
                We have designed all our pages so that they can be read by screen readers, including any tables containing account information and prices. You can find out more information about screen readers and how you can improve your online experience by visiting My web my way.
            </p>
            <h1 class="subHeading">External links</h1>
            <p class="mainContent">
                We will in some places provide links to external websites, where we do so we will alert you with the following icon This links to a site outside of Hargreaves Lansdown and will load in a new browser window. Hargreaves Lansdown is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.
            </p>
            <h1 class="subHeading">Keeping your browser up-to-date</h1>
            <p class="mainContent">
                We will continue to take advantage of new developments in browser technology to make sure that our site continues to be accessible as possible. We therefore recommend that you use as up-to-date a browser as you can which is almost always free to do.

            <h1 class="subHeading">Key Accessibility Factors</h1>
            <div class="mainContent">
                So that you can have an improved online experience, we have incorporated the following key accessibility factors into this site:
                <ul style="list-style:circle">
                    <li>A standard, easy-to-read font has been used throughout.</li>
                    <li>Simple descriptive text is used to define hyperlinks clearly.</li>
                    <li>Alternative descriptions for images and for links are provided where appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Font sizes can be increased to make the site easier to read.</li>
                    <li>Strong contrast colour palettes make the site easier for visually impaired users and for those using low-colour display devices.</li>
                    <li>The use of Flash or frames has been kept to a minimum, to avoid interference with screen readers.</li>
                    <li>It has been tested across all commonly held browsers (if you access the site through AOL, you can use the IE browser that accompanies it without any problems).</li>
                    <li>All pages on the site conform to the XHTML 1.0 Transitional Standard.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h1 class="subHeading">Problem Solving</h1>
            <p class="mainContent">
                In order to diagnose problems that you might be having with the website, our online support team may ask you to provide some of the technical details of your computer set up.<br><br>

                Our website offers information about investing and saving, but not personal advice. If you're not sure which investments are right for you, please request advice, for example from our financial advisers. If you decide to invest, read our important investment notes first and remember that investments can go up and down in value, so you could get back less than you put in.
